\f0\fs24 \cf0 1. I am planning to play an improvised piece with a instrument that I develop and map to a nanokontrol 2.  The sounds will be mostly high frequencies, clicks, and hums that I will create predominantly through use of chaotic and demand rate UGens.  I will perform from the stage and use a small tabletop setup of either small speakers or transduced objects, depending on what sounds better with the sounds I create.  My duration will be between 12-15 minutes max.\
2.  I plan to be ready to perform my piece in the concert hall by April 18th at the latest.\
3.  I will be playing with my laptop and either small speakers or small transduced objects that will need to be mic'd.  The sounding objects will fit on a tabletop, and I should need no more than two microphones, either as overheads or as close mikes depending on the set up.}
